# What is PHP Ender Chest?
PHP Ender Chest is an  extremely simple single-file PHP application designed to turn any PC into a high speed LAN file server in just a few clicks.

# Features
* Single file - PEC comes in the form of a single PHP file named "index.php". You drag this file into your webserver, connect, and PEC handles the rest.
* Uploading - If you'd prefer using the webpage (or would like others to upload to your folder) you can set an uploader password in the file.
* Download or view - Every file has a "view" and "explicit download" button after it. Sometimes a browser doesn't know if you want to view/stream a file as opposed to directly download it. PEC lets the user specify thanks to HTML5 forced download attribute.
Easy -
