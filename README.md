# What is Index Of 2.0?
IO20 an  extremely simple single-file PHP application designed to turn any device into a high speed LAN/internet file server in just a few clicks. All you need is a webserver application with PHP support such as [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). Once it's running, just drag IO20's index.php into the public folder and visitors should automatically see it when they visit your IP in their web browser.

# About
* So much better than seeing an ugly browser-generated "index-of", especially considering some browsers do a much worse job than others. There's no consistency in appearance or functionality across browsers and platforms. IO20 solves this by making every browser and platform see exactly the same page.
* Single file - IO20 comes in the form of a single PHP file named "index.php". You drag this file into your webserver, connect, and IO20 handles the rest.
* Uploading - If you'd prefer using the webpage (or would like others to upload to your folder) you can set an uploader password in the file.
* Download or view - Every file has a "view" and "explicit download" button after it. Sometimes a browser doesn't know if you want to view/stream a file as opposed to directly download it. IO20 lets the user specify thanks to HTML5 forced download attribute.
* Easy - As the webmaster, all you have to do is drop IO20 into the folder. Visitors will automatically see a generated file list of the relative directory.

# Tips
Keep the host machine connected to ethernet rather than WiFi. Over WiFi, the bandwidth could max out with as few as 3-4 machines accessing IO20. Gigabit is recommended.
