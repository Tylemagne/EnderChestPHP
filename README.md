# What is Index Of 2.0?
IO20 an  extremely simple single-file PHP application designed to turn any PC into a high speed LAN/internet file server in just a few clicks. All you need is a webserver application with PHP support such as XAMPP. Once it's running, just drag IO20's index.php into the public folder and visitors should automatically see it when they visit your IP in their web browser.

# About
* So much better than seeing an ugly "index-of".
* Single file - IO20 comes in the form of a single PHP file named "index.php". You drag this file into your webserver, connect, and IO20 handles the rest.
* Uploading - If you'd prefer using the webpage (or would like others to upload to your folder) you can set an uploader password in the file.
* Download or view - Every file has a "view" and "explicit download" button after it. Sometimes a browser doesn't know if you want to view/stream a file as opposed to directly download it. IO20 lets the user specify thanks to HTML5 forced download attribute.
* Easy - As the webmaster, all you have to do is drop IO20 into the folder. Visitors will automatically see a generated file list of the relative directory.
